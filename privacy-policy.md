# Privacy Policy for Accessibility Text Enhancer

**Last updated:** February 18, 2026

Thank you for using the Accessibility Text Enhancer extension ("the Extension"). This privacy policy explains what information we collect and how it is used.

## Data Collection
The Accessibility Text Enhancer is committed to protecting your privacy. We collect only the minimum information necessary to provide core functionality.

### 1. User Preferences (Local Storage)
The Extension uses Chrome's `storage.local` API to save your accessibility settings (e.g., font size preferences, bold toggles, contrast settings) on a per-website basis. This data is stored **locally on your device** and is never transmitted to our servers or any third party. This allows the Extension to remember your preferences when you revisit websites.

### 2. No Collection of Personal Information
The Extension **does not** collect, store, or transmit:
- Your name, email address, or any personal identifiers
- Browsing history
- Passwords or form data
- Financial information
- Cookies or tracking data
- The content of the web pages you visit

### 3. Text-to-Speech Processing
The "Read Aloud" feature uses your browser's built-in Web Speech API. All text-to-speech processing occurs **locally on your device**. No text content from web pages is sent to external servers for this feature.

### 4. Performance Metrics
Aggregate, non-identifiable performance data (such as success rates of toolbar injection and memory usage) may be collected **locally** for research purposes as part of ongoing academic study. This data is anonymized and cannot be traced back to individual users.

## Data Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or transfer your information to any third party. We do not use analytics services or tracking pixels.

## Third-Party Links
The Extension operates on various websites but has no control over the content or privacy practices of those external sites.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We encourage users to frequently check this page for any changes.

## Consent
By using the Extension, you consent to this privacy policy.
